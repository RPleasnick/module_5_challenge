### Analysis ###

The objestive of this analysis is to see how potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) performed in comparision to Capomulin.  In this study, 248 mice were given one of the 10 drug regimens over the coarse of 45 days, and tumor volume was recorded.  The study had an even distribution of female and male subjects.

Capomulin and Raminican had the smallest overall total average tumor volume at around 40 mm3.  While Ceftamin and Infubinol had an overall total average tumor volume of 53 mm3.  As seen on the boxplot chart, Capomulin and Ceftamin had the smallest tumors at the end of the study.  There was was also a correlation between the weight and side of the tumor for the mice on the Capomulin.
 
### Conclusion ###

It was observed that Capomulin is a strong option in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma.  However, Ceftamin had a greater decrease in tumor size.  One could also conclude that the tumor may decrease in size as weight decreases.
